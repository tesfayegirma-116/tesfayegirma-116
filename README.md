## API Expertise

| API Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| REST API | Proficient in designing and implementing RESTful services using Node.js, Express, and other frameworks. Experienced in creating scalable and secure APIs for web and mobile applications. |
| GraphQL | Skilled in leveraging GraphQL for efficient data querying and manipulation. Capable of setting up GraphQL servers and integrating them with various databases and services. |

## Architecture Expertise

| Architecture Style | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Monolithic Architecture | Experienced in developing applications where all components are interconnected and interdependent, built on a single code base. This approach is suitable for simple applications or prototypes, offering a straightforward development process but can become complex and difficult to maintain as the application grows. |
| Microservices Architecture | Skilled in designing and implementing applications as a collection of small, independent services. Each service is responsible for a specific business capability and communicates with others through well-defined interfaces. This approach allows for greater flexibility, scalability, and easier maintenance, though it requires more planning and infrastructure at the start. |
